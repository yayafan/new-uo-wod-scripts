The World of Dreams UO Server script files for POL 095 and 099.

## News ##
**Thu Jan 2nd, 2014:** Please **DON'T** download from zip files, use the svn repository, as it contains the latest scripts. You will require a very recent build of POL 099 from the POL forums, as the one from their downloads section is too old.

**Sat Nov 19th, 2011:** The WoD scripts for POL 099 have been released as a downloadable file. Check our downloads section and read the file description for brief instructions on how to generate the Realm files required for running.
